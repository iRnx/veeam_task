Demonstration of working code: #

To activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`

This task consists of synchronizing 2 folders and everything I do in folder1 will also be done in folder2.

The program stays in a `while True` to be able to do all the monitoring, when some action happens it will be
triggered a message in the log and in the console.

I also decided to do an extra part, the `find_file` function finds every type of file in the `origin_folder` folder, and brings back some information about the file

Well, I really enjoyed this challenge, I know I could do a lot more, but so far that's what I've managed to do, a simple and complex challenge at the same time, I hope you like it and thank you very much for this opportunity you've given me to prove my worth.
